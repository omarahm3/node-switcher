> Multi git repositories project organizer made with Nodejs.

This project is pretty immature, it was created initially as a fish shell function, so that i can easily manage my company's current multiple projects, since i usually have changes on different branches on multiple git repositories, and we can't leverage git-worktree on our local development. This project aims to manage multiple git repositories with richer features than the initial fish shell version.
This project has also other variants in different programming languages.
- [Fish Shell](https://github.com/omarahm3/projects-switcher)
- [Rust Switcher](https://github.com/omarahm3/switcher)

I will be focusing more on maintaining the Rust variant.
